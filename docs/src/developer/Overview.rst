Overview
~~~~~~~~

This project is intended to act as a skeleton for any SKA developer looking to make a React based web application.

It includes tools for linting, code formatting, and testing which are easily integrated into various IDEs.
It also includes modular federation, exposing the ReactSkeleton component, which can be imported into other applications.
